### About this project
\
This is a clone page of an open-source platform, SonarQube. This clone is a part of the test task in my interview with 'Project Flux'. 
\
\
My test task is to hypothetically lead a team of 5 junior developers to replicate 100% SonarQube. My part is to design and replicate the main website of SonarQube. I made this responsive with all type of devices.
